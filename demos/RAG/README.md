# RAG Pipeline Demo

## About
This project is a demo for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using NexaSDK and NexaAI Python binding.
It showcases how to combine state-of-the-art embeddings, reranking, and generation models to answer questions over your own documents.

**Key features:**
- 🌐 Multi-platform support — Works on Snapdragon NPU (Windows ARM), macOS, and Windows x64
- 🔄 End-to-end RAG demo — From document ingestion to retrieval and answer generation
- 💻 Local execution — All processing happens on your device; no data leaves your machine
- ⚡ Easy to run — Minimal setup to explore NexaSDK / NexaAI capabilities

Bring your own files (PDFs, Word docs, text) and ask questions—the system retrieves relevant context and generates answers entirely on your device.
